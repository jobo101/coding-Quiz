# coding-Quiz

## Description
 
This project was assigned to test my knowledge of API's.  The questions are introduced one at a time and
processed with either correct or incorrect as output.  The timer should start immediately and incorrect answers result in a 10 second penalty decuction.  At the end of the quiz the user is asked to input theire initials and their results are stored on a separate page.

Unfortunately i was unable to make the code work and therefore i have not submitted any screenshots of the 
quiz in progress.
